## Appearance

The appearance setting in UnifyUI Preset determines whether your output CSS includes light, dark, or both modes.

- If appearance is set to `dark`, the output CSS will only concern dark mode. It will use values from the dark object if it exists and ignore the default light settings.
- If appearance is set to `light`, the output CSS will only concern light mode.
- If appearance is set to `both`, the output CSS will include both light and dark modes where needed, checking for the existence of dark mode settings and applying them appropriately.


## Configuration

To set the appearance configuration:

<BlockCode>
```js
// uno.config.ts
import { presetUI } from "@unifydev/preset-ui"

export default defineConfig({
  // ...config
  presets: [
    presetUI({
        appearance:"both",//default is both
    })
  ],
});
```
</BlockCode>

For example, if you set the appearance to dark, the engine will use the values provided by the dark object if it exists:

```js
// uno.config.ts
import { presetUI } from "@unifydev/preset-ui"

export default defineConfig({
  // ...config
  presets: [
    presetUI({
        appearance: "dark", // only use dark mode settings
        globalElement: {
            solid: {
                bgShade: "400",// will be ignore
                textShade: "900", // ignored too
                // dark mode settings
                dark: { // will use only this
                    bgShade: "600",
                    textShade: "100",
                }
            }
        }
    })
  ],
});

```

If the appearance is set to `both`, it will check for dark mode settings and apply them for dark mode.
