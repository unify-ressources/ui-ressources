description: Simplify the customization of your project by using the theming options in the UnoCSS configuration file.

You can override the default utility classes and their behavior, as well as change colors, fonts, and default class values, to better suit your design needs.

## Theming

UnifyUI Preset uses semantic color names to make it easy to understand and configure the purpose of each color. This approach ensures a consistent and intuitive theming experience.

## Configuring Colors

To configure colors in your uno.config.(js|ts) file, follow this example. It is recommended to use semantic names for your colors:

<BlockCode>
```js
import { colors } from "@unocss/preset-mini/colors"; // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
  theme: { // [!code ++]
    colors: { // [!code ++]
      inherit: colors.inherit, // [!code ++]
      current: colors.current, // [!code ++]
      transparent: colors.transparent, // [!code ++]
      primary: colors.indigo,
      // add other colors for secondary, accent, success, danger, info, warning, etc if needed.
      success: colors.green, // [!code ++]
      danger: colors.red, // [!code ++]
      info: colors.blue, // [!code ++]
      warning: colors.yellow, // [!code ++]
      black: colors.black, // [!code ++]
      gray: colors.zinc, // [!code ++]
      white: colors.white, // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  },
  // other config
});

```
</BlockCode>


Using semantic names like primary, success, danger, info, and warning helps maintain a clear and organized color system in your project.
